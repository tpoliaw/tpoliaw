## Software Engineer at Diamond Light Source

Mainly using Java, Rust and Python.

I have projects scattered over many source hosting sites, so for want of some
time spend consolidating them, the highlights:

### Personal Projects

#### Jaded


A rust crate for reading data serialized using Java's built in serialization
format. It allows safe reading of data without the security risks associated
with reading untrusted data in Java.

* [Repo](https://gitlab.com/woollyGibbon/jaded)
* [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/jaded)

#### Enquiries

Python library for requesting input from users in the form of multiple choice or
confirmation selections.

* [Repo](https://gitlab.com/facingBackwards/enquiries)
* [PyPI](https://pypi.org/projects/enquiries)

### Diamond Light Source

All development at DLS is open source where possible so much of my work is
available publicly

#### GDA

A large, Java application used as the main acquisition platform at diamond for
almost all beamlines for the past 20 years.

The core application is available in
[openGDA/gda-core](https://github.com/openGDA/gda-core/commits?author=tpoliaw)

#### Athena platform

The new, service based acquisition stack is hosted in the DiamondLightSource
organisation. Key projects I have been involved in are

* [numtracker](https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/numtracker) - A central
  service to provide consistent file naming, numbering and paths across
  different acquisition applications.
* [blueAPI](https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/blueapi) - Wrapper service
  around the BlueSky library from NSLS-II allowing remote access.

#### Agit

Written at Diamond out of personal need to streamline management of changes
across multiple repositories. Run git commands on multiple repos and switch
multiple branches at once to match topics in Gerrit.

* [Repo](https://github.com/tpoliaw/agit)


### Everything else

A few of open-source libraries and applications I use and contribute to when I
can

* [Atuin](https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin) - Magical shell history
* [ptpython](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/ptpython) - Python REPL with
  syntax highlighting, code completion, multiline editing
* [delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) - Better git pager
* [the-way](https://github.com/out-of-cheese-error/the-way) - Local code snippet
  handler
